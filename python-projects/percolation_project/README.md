This project implements a simulation of the site percolation problem on a square lattice using Monte Carlo methods. The model analyzes the probability of forming a connected path between the first and last row of the lattice as a function of occupation probability p.

The implementation is based on the Burning Method, which is used to determine whether a percolating path exists in each simulation run. The program reads input parameters (such as lattice size, number of trials, and probability range) from an external configuration file (perc_ini.txt).

To execute the project, the percolation_burning_method module must first be run for different input configurations. The generated results are then used as input for the percolation_threshold module, which produces the final plots illustrating the relationship between percolation probability and p.
